            <div class="timeline-item">
              <div class="timeline-date">1955-1969</div>
              <h4>Educational Journey</h4>
              <p>Graduated in physics from Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli. Earned his degree in aerospace
                engineering from Madras Institute of Technology. Joined the Defense Research and Development
                Organization (DRDO) as a scientist in 1958.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
              <div class="timeline-date">1969-1999</div>
              <h4>Scientific Leadership</h4>
              <p>Transferred to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) where he served as the project director
                for India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III). Returned to DRDO as Chief Executive of the
                Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP), leading to the development of Agni and Prithvi
                missiles. Served as Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister before retiring from scientific
                service.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
              <div class="timeline-date">2002-2007</div>
              <h4>Presidency</h4>
              <p>Served as the 11th President of India, known for his accessible approach, connection with youth, and

              <p>After completing his term as President, devoted himself to teaching and inspiring students across
                India. Traveled tirelessly to address young audiences, authored inspirational books, and advocated for
                sustainable development. Passed away while delivering a lecture to students at IIM Shillong on July 27,
                2015.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h4>Scientific Contributions</h4>
          <p>Kalam played a crucial role in developing India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III), which
            successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in 1980. As the architect of India's integrated guided missile
            development program, he led teams that developed strategic and tactical missiles, earning him the nickname
            "Missile Man." His contributions to military defense technology helped India achieve self-reliance in
            critical areas. Kalam also made significant contributions to healthcare through the development of the
            lightweight "Kalam-Raju Stent" for coronary heart disease and a cost-effective artificial limb called
            "Kalam-Raju Tablet."</p>

          <h4>Vision for India</h4>
          <p>Dr. Kalam envisioned India becoming a developed nation by 2020 through what he called "Vision 2020." He
            identified five key areas—education, agriculture, information technology, infrastructure, and self-reliance
            in critical technologies—as pillars for national development. His concept of PURA (Providing Urban Amenities
            in Rural Areas) aimed to bridge the urban-rural divide through connectivity, knowledge, and economic
            opportunities. An advocate for sustainable development, Kalam emphasized renewable energy, water
            conservation, and appropriate technology.</p>

          <h4>Legacy and Impact</h4>
          <p>Beyond his scientific achievements, Kalam's greatest legacy may be his ability to inspire the youth with
            his simplicity, integrity, and vision. His books like "Wings of Fire," "Ignited Minds," and "India 2020"
            continue to motivate readers. Educational institutions, scientific facilities, and innovation hubs across
            India bear his name, perpetuating his memory. The United Nations recognized his birth anniversary (October
            15) as "World Students' Day," acknowledging his lifelong commitment to education and mentorship. Dr. Kalam
            embodied his own philosophy: "Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts, and thoughts result in
            action."</p>
