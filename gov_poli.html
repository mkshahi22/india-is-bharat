         <h1>India's Democracy: Unity in Diversity</h1>
         <p>India stands as the world's largest democracy, a union of 28 states and 8 union territories bound together
            by a
            constitutional framework that balances unity with regional diversity. From its independence in 1947 to its
            position as a global power today, India's political journey reflects a unique experiment in democratic
            governance within an extraordinarily diverse society.</p>

         <h3>Constitutional Framework</h3>
         <div class="constitution-section">
            <div class="constitution-info">
               <p>The Constitution of India, adopted on January 26, 1950, established the republic as a sovereign,
                  socialist,
                  secular, and democratic nation. As one of the world's longest written constitutions, it creates a
                  comprehensive framework for governance while incorporating mechanisms for evolution through
                  amendments.</p>

                     <p>India maintains a parliamentary system within a federal structure, incorporating fundamental
                        rights,
                        directive principles of state policy, and fundamental duties that guide the relationship between

                     <h4>Amendments and Evolution</h4>
                     <p>With over 100 amendments since inception, the constitution has evolved to address changing
                        national
                        priorities while preserving its "basic structure" as defined by landmark Supreme Court

                  <h4>Executive</h4>
                  <p>India has a dual executive system: the President serves as head of state, while the Prime Minister
                     leads
                     the Council of Ministers as head of government. Executive authority flows from the Parliament,
                     making the
                     cabinet collectively responsible to the legislature.</p>

               <div class="pillar-item">
                  <h4>Legislature</h4>
                  <p>The bicameral Parliament consists of the Lok Sabha (House of the People) with 543 directly elected
                     members, and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) with 245 members representing states and
                     territories. The
                     system balances popular representation with federal principles.</p>

               <div class="pillar-item">
                  <h4>Judiciary</h4>
                  <p>An independent judiciary headed by the Supreme Court serves as the ultimate interpreter of the
                     constitution. The judicial system includes High Courts at the state level and a hierarchy of
                     subordinate
                     courts, with powers of judicial review ensuring constitutional compliance.</p>

               <div class="pillar-item">
                  <h4>Federal-State Relations</h4>
                  <p>The constitution divides powers between the Union and States through three lists: Union, State, and
                     Concurrent. This arrangement creates a cooperative federalism where authority is shared while
                     maintaining
                     the Union's primacy in national matters.</p>

                        security and proper administration. Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) have replaced paper
