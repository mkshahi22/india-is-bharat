      <h1>India's Ancient Past: The Foundations of Civilization</h1>
      <p>The ancient period of Indian history spans from the earliest human settlements around 75,000 BCE to
        approximately 550 CE. This vast timeframe witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, the birth of major
        religious traditions, unprecedented architectural achievements, and sophisticated systems of philosophy,
        science, and governance. During this period, the foundations were laid for the cultural, spiritual, and
        intellectual traditions that continue to shape India and the world today.</p>

      <h3>Vedic Age</h3>
      <div class="vedic-section">
        <div class="vedic-info">
          <p>The Vedic period (approximately 1500-500 BCE) represents a formative era in Indian cultural and religious
            history. Named after the Vedas, four collections of hymns, philosophical dialogues, and ritual instructions
            transmitted orally for centuries before being committed to writing, this period witnessed the development of
            complex religious beliefs, social structures, and philosophical inquiry.</p>

          <div class="vedic-aspects">
            <div class="aspect-item">
              <h4>Vedic Literature</h4>
              <p>The four Vedas (Rig, Sama, Yajur, and Atharva) form the earliest layer of Sanskrit literature. These
                were supplemented by Brahmanas (ritual commentaries), Aranyakas (forest texts), and Upanishads
                (philosophical treatises exploring concepts like Brahman, Atman, and karma).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="aspect-item">
              <h4>Social Structure</h4>
              <p>The varna system emerged during this period, eventually stratifying society into four groups
                (Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras) based on occupation rather than the rigid caste system of
                later periods. Tribal assemblies called sabhas and samitis provided elements of participatory
                governance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="aspect-item">
              <h4>Religious Practices</h4>
              <p>Early Vedic religion centered on nature deities like Indra, Varuna, and Agni, with elaborate yajna
                (fire sacrifices) conducted by specialized priests. Later Vedic thought shifted toward abstraction and
                internalization of ritual, ultimately leading to concepts of world-renunciation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="aspect-item">
              <h4>Geographical Expansion</h4>
              <p>The period saw gradual eastward movement from the Punjab region into the Ganges Plain, with iron
                technology facilitating forest clearance and agricultural expansion. By the late Vedic period,
                significant urbanization was occurring in the central Gangetic basin.</p>

            <h4>Buddhism</h4>
            <p>Arising in the 6th century BCE through the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha), Buddhism
              challenged Brahmanical orthodoxy by rejecting the authority of the Vedas and the caste system. The
              Buddha's Middle Path emphasized the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path as means to overcome
              suffering. Buddhism spread rapidly under imperial patronage, particularly during the Mauryan Empire under
              Ashoka, eventually influencing arts, architecture, and philosophy across Asia.</p>

            <h4>Jainism</h4>
            <p>Formalized by Vardhamana Mahavira (a contemporary of Buddha), Jainism emphasized ahimsa (non-violence),
              anekantavada (many-sidedness of reality), and aparigraha (non-possession). Jains developed distinctive
              concepts of karma as physical particles and practiced asceticism aimed at liberating the soul from the
              cycle of rebirth. Jain contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and literature significantly influenced

            <p>Founded by Makkhali Gosala, this now-extinct tradition emphasized niyati (destiny or determinism),
              rejecting free will and karma. The Ajivikas believed in an elaborate cosmic cycle of 8.4 million
              mahakalpas through which all souls must transmigrate. Despite royal patronage from rulers like Bindusara,
              the movement gradually declined after the Mauryan period.</p>

            <p>This materialist, atheistic philosophy rejected metaphysical concepts like karma and afterlife,
              emphasizing direct perception and rational inquiry. Charvakas critiqued religious ritual as exploitative
              and proposed that consciousness emerges from material elements. Though their original texts have been

          <p>The Mauryan Empire (322-185 BCE) represents India's first major imperial power, unifying most of the
            subcontinent under centralized rule. Founded by Chandragupta Maurya after Alexander's departure from
            northwestern India, the empire reached its zenith under Emperor Ashoka before gradually declining under

              <h4>Ashoka the Great</h4>

                focused on social welfare, religious tolerance, and moral governance. His rock and pillar edicts, spread
                across the subcontinent, constitute India's earliest decipherable written records.</p>

                bureaucracy, systematic taxation, regulated trade, and an elaborate spy network. The empire was divided
                into provinces governed by royal princes and officials, with villages serving as basic administrative

      <h3>The Gupta Empire: India's Golden Age</h3>
      <div class="gupta-section">
        <div class="gupta-info">
          <p>The Gupta period (320-550 CE) is frequently described as India's "Golden Age," a time of unprecedented
            cultural and intellectual flourishing. Under rulers like Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, and Chandragupta II
            (Vikramaditya), the empire controlled much of Northern India and fostered remarkable achievements across
            sciences, arts, and philosophy.</p>

          <div class="gupta-achievements">
            <div class="achievement-item">
              <h4>Mathematics & Astronomy</h4>
              <p>Mathematicians like Aryabhata and Varahamihira made groundbreaking contributions including the concept
                of zero, decimal system, calculation of π, and heliocentric theories. Algebraic, trigonometric, and
                astronomical discoveries during this period laid foundations for modern mathematics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="achievement-item">
              <h4>Literature & Arts</h4>
              <p>Sanskrit literature reached its pinnacle with Kalidasa's poetry and dramas. The period also saw the
                compilation of the Puranas, development of classical dance forms, and refinement of musical theory. The
                exquisite Ajanta cave paintings exemplify the sophisticated visual arts of the era.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="achievement-item">
              <h4>Religious Developments</h4>
              <p>Hindu traditions underwent significant evolution, with the emergence of deity-centered worship (bhakti)
                and sophisticated theological systems. While the Gupta rulers were Hindu, they practiced religious
                tolerance, allowing Buddhism and Jainism to continue flourishing.</p>

            <div class="achievement-item">

            <p>The varna system evolved into the more complex jati (caste) structure that would characterize Indian
              society for millennia. Family units operated within patriarchal frameworks, with significant regional
              variations in women's status and rights. Urban centers developed sophisticated social stratification,

              <p>From the precisely planned cities of the Indus Valley to the rock-cut caves of the Deccan,
                architectural traditions emphasized both practicality and symbolic meaning. Early Buddhist stupas at

                achieved a perfect balance of realism and idealization that influenced all subsequent Buddhist art.</p>
