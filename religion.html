         <h1>Culture and Religion: The Soul of India</h1>
         <p>For thousands of years, India has been a cradle of diverse religious traditions and cultural expressions.
            From ancient philosophical inquiries to vibrant contemporary practices, the spiritual and cultural landscape
            of India represents one of humanity's most profound and continuous explorations of existence, meaning, and
            expression. This extraordinary diversity has flourished within a tradition of pluralism often described as
            "unity in diversity."</p>

               <h4>Hinduism</h4>
               <p>The world's oldest continuously practiced religion, Hinduism encompasses a wide variety of beliefs,
                  practices, and philosophical schools. With approximately 80% of India's population identifying as
                  Hindu, the tradition has profoundly shaped Indian culture through concepts like dharma (righteous
                  duty), karma (action and consequence), and moksha (spiritual liberation). Sacred texts include the
                  Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Puranas.</p>

               <h4>Islam</h4>
               <p>With over 200 million adherents, India has one of the world's largest Muslim populations. Islam
                  arrived in the subcontinent through traders, missionaries, and conquests beginning in the 7th century
                  and established deep cultural roots. The syncretic traditions that emerged, like Sufism, significantly
                  influenced India's cultural landscape through architecture, music, cuisine, and literature.</p>

               <h4>Sikhism</h4>
               <p>Founded by Guru Nanak in the 15th century Punjab, Sikhism emphasizes equality, service to humanity,
                  and devotion to one formless God. The Sikh community (Khalsa) and its places of worship (Gurdwaras)
                  are known for service through langar (community kitchen) and other charitable activities. The Golden
                  Temple in Amritsar serves as the spiritual center for Sikhs worldwide.</p>

               <h4>Buddhism</h4>
               <p>Though Buddhism originated in India with Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha) in the 6th century BCE, it later
                  declined in its homeland while flourishing elsewhere in Asia. Today, Buddhism is experiencing a
                  revival in India, particularly among Dalit communities influenced by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's conversion.
                  Major Buddhist sites like Bodh Gaya, where Buddha attained enlightenment, remain important pilgrimage
                  destinations.</p>

               <h4>Jainism</h4>
               <p>Dating back to the 6th century BCE with Mahavira as its most recent Tirthankara (spiritual leader),
                  Jainism emphasizes non-violence (ahimsa), truthfulness, and non-possession. The Jain community has
                  profoundly influenced Indian philosophy, art, and business practices, with elaborate temples like
                  those at Ranakpur and Mount Abu showcasing their architectural contributions.</p>

               <p>Christianity traces its roots in India to the 1st century CE through St. Thomas, with significant
                  communities in Kerala and the Northeast. Zoroastrianism arrived with Parsi refugees from Persia,
                  creating a small but influential community. Judaism has ancient roots in Kerala, while Bahai'i and
                  tribal religious practices further enrich India's spiritual landscape.</p>

                        developed by Adi Shankaracharya propose that ultimate reality (Brahman) and individual
