            <p>India's remarkable social fabric spans thousands of years of civilization, hundreds of languages, and
                countless
                traditions. As the nation transforms through rapid economic growth and modernization, it grapples with
                complex
                social challenges that reflect both its ancient heritage and contemporary realities. From addressing
                historical
                inequalities to embracing new technologies, India's social evolution represents one of humanity's most
                fascinating journeys.</p>

                    <p>The evolution of the caste system created complex social hierarchies that influenced occupation,
                        marriage, and social mobility. Religious diversity flourished alongside social stratification,
                        creating both pluralism and division.</p>

                    <h4>Youth Bulge</h4>
                    <p>India's demographic dividend presents both opportunity and challenge, with over 12 million young
                        people entering the workforce annually. While this young population could drive decades of
                        economic growth, inadequate skill development and job creation have led to youth unemployment
                        rates of 23%. The mismatch between education and employment has created a paradox of unemployed
                        graduates alongside unfilled skilled positions.</p>

                    <p>While youth dominate current demographics, India's elderly population (60+) is projected to reach
                        20% by 2050, creating new challenges in healthcare, social security, and family support systems.
                        Traditional joint family structures that cared for the elderly are evolving, particularly in
                        urban areas, creating the need for institutional eldercare frameworks and pension systems that
                        remain underdeveloped.</p>

                    <h4>Rural-Urban Migration</h4>
                    <p>Approximately 10 million people migrate annually from rural to urban areas seeking economic
                        opportunities, creating unprecedented pressure on urban infrastructure and services. This
                        migration also disrupts traditional social support networks and creates new vulnerabilities,
                        particularly for women and children. Urban centers struggle with inadequate housing, resulting

                    <p>Despite improvements, India's sex ratio remains concerning at 929 females per 1,000 males (2023).
                        Son preference continues to manifest in some regions despite legal prohibition of sex-selective
                        practices. States including Haryana and Punjab face acute gender imbalances, while Kerala and
                        northeastern states maintain more balanced ratios. Addressing this imbalance requires both
                        enforcement and cultural shift.</p>

                    <p>India's journey toward gender equality presents a complex picture of progress and persistent
                        challenges. Women's participation in education, politics, and the workforce has grown
                        significantly, yet traditional gender norms and structural barriers continue to limit full

                                boys in higher education enrollment. However, dropout rates remain higher for girls in

                                million women into political leadership. Women now comprise 14.6% of Parliament, with
