      <p>India presents an unparalleled linguistic landscape, home to thousands of languages and dialects that have
        evolved over millennia. From ancient Sanskrit to modern digital expressions, India's languages reflect its
        complex cultural heritage, regional identities, and historical exchanges. More than just communication tools,
        these languages embody distinct worldviews, literary traditions, and cultural knowledge systems that continue
        to shape the nation's diverse identity.</p>

      <h3>Historical Evolution of Indian Languages</h3>
      <div class="timeline-section">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-date">3000 BCE - 500 CE</div>
          <h4>Ancient Language Development</h4>
          <p>Sanskrit emerged as a refined language of ritual, literature, and learning, while Prakrit variants
            served as vernacular languages. The Dravidian family developed independently in southern India, with
            Tamil having the oldest attested literary tradition dating back to 300 BCE.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-date">500 - 1200 CE</div>
          <h4>Medieval Transformation</h4>
          <p>The regional Prakrits evolved into distinct languages like Apabhramsha, which later gave rise to Hindi,
            Bengali, Marathi, and other modern Indo-Aryan languages. Classical forms of Telugu, Kannada, and
            Malayalam emerged in the south, with rich court patronage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-date">1200 - 1800 CE</div>
          <h4>Cultural Exchange & Synthesis</h4>
          <p>Persian became the court language under various Muslim dynasties, while Urdu developed as a syncretic
            language blending Persian, Arabic, and indigenous vocabulary with Indic grammar. Regional languages
            flourished through bhakti and sufi movements that brought literature to common people.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-date">1800 - Present</div>
          <h4>Modernization & Revival</h4>
          <p>English entered India's linguistic landscape, while vernacular languages underwent standardization and
            revival. Post-independence language policies established official status for multiple languages,
            reflecting India's commitment to linguistic pluralism despite tensions and negotiations around language
            identity.</p>
