               <p>Ancient Indian texts reference martial arts, wrestling (mallakhamb), archery, chariot racing, and
                  board
                  games like chaturanga (precursor to chess). Physical prowess was highly valued in Vedic society, with

                  matches,
                  and hunting expeditions. Regional forms of physical contests flourished under royal patronage, with

                  tournaments,
                  and infrastructure. These sports initially limited to colonial elites gradually gained wider Indian

               <h4>Cricket</h4>
               <p>Cricket transcends sport to become cultural phenomenon in India, inspiring devotion across
                  socioeconomic
                  divides. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the world's wealthiest cricket
                  organization,
                  with the Indian Premier League revolutionizing the sport through its franchise model, celebrity
                  ownership,
                  and entertainment fusion. India's national team ranks consistently among world leaders and has claimed
                  ODI
                  World Cup victories in 1983, 2011, and 2023, cementing cricket as the nation's sporting religion.</p>

               <h4>Hockey</h4>
               <p>Once India's most successful Olympic sport with eight gold medals, hockey holds a special place in
                  national
                  sporting history. Though international dominance has waned since the 1980s, recent resurgence includes
                  the
                  2020 Olympic bronze medal. The Hockey India League (2013-2017) introduced professional structures
                  while
                  development programs are rebuilding grassroots participation. Hockey's legacy as India's first
                  international
                  team sport success remains influential despite cricket's commercial overshadowing.</p>

               <h4>Football</h4>
               <p>India's football relationship balances growing international viewership with developing domestic
                  competition. Historical successes include the 1962 Asian Games gold medal and 1956 Olympic semi-final
                  appearance. The Indian Super League (est. 2014) has elevated standards through international players,
                  improved facilities, and increased viewership. Mohun Bagan and East Bengal's century-old rivalry
                  represents
                  one of world football's oldest derbies, while youth programs and grassroots initiatives are

                  future prospects for the national team.</p>

               <h4>Badminton</h4>
               <p>Badminton has emerged as India's second most successful individual Olympic sport, with Prakash
                  Padukone's
                  1980 All England championship pioneering international success. The Pullela Gopichand Academy has
                  produced
                  champions including PV Sindhu (Olympic silver and bronze medals), Saina Nehwal (Olympic bronze), and
                  Lakshya
