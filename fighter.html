      <p>India's journey to independence was paved with the unwavering determination, sacrifice, and vision of countless
        freedom fighters who challenged colonial rule through various movements and ideologies. From peaceful
        non-cooperation to armed resistance, these patriots employed diverse strategies united by a common goal: a free
        and sovereign India. Their legacy continues to inspire generations and shape the national character of modern

          <p>Subhash Chandra Bose, affectionately known as "Netaji" (Respected Leader), stands as one of India's most
            charismatic and revolutionary freedom fighters. His dramatic life, military leadership, and mysterious
            disappearance have created a legacy that continues to captivate the Indian imagination.</p>

              <div class="timeline-date">January 23, 1897</div>
              <h4>Early Life</h4>
              <p>Born in Cuttack, Odisha, to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi. Displayed brilliance from an early
                age, graduating with honors from Presidency College, Calcutta. Achieved 4th position in the prestigious
                Indian Civil Service examination in England but resigned to join India's freedom struggle.</p>

              <div class="timeline-date">1921-1938</div>
              <h4>Political Rise</h4>
              <p>Mentored by Chittaranjan Das and rapidly rose within Congress. Twice elected President of the Indian
                National Congress (1938 and 1939). Formed the Forward Bloc after ideological differences with Gandhi and
                the Congress leadership on strategies for independence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
              <div class="timeline-date">1941-1943</div>
              <h4>Dramatic Escape</h4>
              <p>Placed under house arrest by the British but made a daring escape in disguise. Traveled through
                Afghanistan and Soviet Union to Germany, where he established the Free India Center and formed the
                Indian Legion from Indian prisoners of war.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
              <div class="timeline-date">1943-1945</div>
              <h4>Azad Hind Fauj</h4>
              <p>Traveled by submarine to Japan and took leadership of the Indian National Army (INA). Established the
                Provisional Government of Free India in Singapore, declared war on Britain and the United States, and
                led the INA in battles against Allied forces on Indian soil with the slogan "Delhi Chalo" (March to
                Delhi).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
              <div class="timeline-date">August 18, 1945</div>
              <h4>Mysterious Disappearance</h4>
              <p>Reportedly died in a plane crash in Taiwan, though the circumstances remain controversial with multiple
                theories and investigations continuing decades after independence.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h4>Revolutionary Vision</h4>
          <p>Bose represented a militant approach to independence, believing that freedom would not be granted but had
            to be seized through armed struggle. He sought international alliances during World War II to challenge
            British rule, operating under the principle that "an enemy's enemy is a friend." His leadership unified
            Indians across religious and regional divides under the battle cry of "Jai Hind" (Victory to India).</p>

          <h4>Military Leadership</h4>
          <p>As Supreme Commander of the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army), Bose created a professional military
            force that included the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, one of the world's first all-female combat units. The INA's
            advance into northeastern India represented the first time Indian forces fought on Indian soil for
            independence since 1857.</p>

          <h4>Legacy and Influence</h4>
          <p>Though the INA was ultimately defeated militarily, the subsequent trials of INA officers at Red Fort
            sparked nationwide protests that made British authorities realize they could no longer rely on Indian troops
            to maintain colonial rule. The naval mutiny of 1946, inspired partly by Bose's example, further accelerated
            the British decision to leave India.</p>

          <p>Bose's alternative vision of a strong, centralized India with socialist economic policies and military
            strength continues to influence Indian political thought. His focus on women's empowerment, religious
            harmony, and decisive leadership made him a revolutionary figure ahead of his time.</p>
