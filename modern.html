         <h1>India's Modern Era: Struggle, Freedom, and Nation-Building</h1>
         <p>The modern period of Indian history spans from the mid-18th century to the present day. This transformative
            era witnessed the establishment and decline of British colonial rule, the epic struggle for independence,
            and the remarkable journey of post-colonial nation-building. Through resistance, reform, and revolution,
            India emerged from centuries of foreign domination to forge its own path as the world's largest democracy,
            blending ancient traditions with modern aspirations in its quest for progress and global relevance.</p>

               <div class="timeline-date">1757 - 1857</div>
               <h4>Rise of Colonial Rule</h4>
               <p>Beginning with the Battle of Plassey, the British East India Company gradually expanded control over
                  the subcontinent through military conquests, subsidiary alliances, and the doctrine of lapse. This
                  period saw fundamental changes in administration, land revenue systems, and economic structures that
                  reshaped Indian society.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
               <div class="timeline-date">1857 - 1858</div>
               <h4>First War of Independence</h4>
               <p>The great uprising of 1857, known variously as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, or the First War
                  of Independence, represented the first large-scale challenge to British authority. Though ultimately
                  suppressed, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the establishment of direct Crown
                  rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
               <div class="timeline-date">1858 - 1920</div>
               <h4>British Raj and Reform Movements</h4>
               <p>The era of Crown rule saw significant socio-religious reform movements, the growth of modern
                  education, and the beginning of organized nationalist politics. The Indian National Congress was
                  founded in 1885, while social reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Jyotiba Phule challenged
                  traditional inequities.</p>

               <div class="timeline-date">1920 - 1947</div>
               <h4>Freedom Struggle</h4>
               <p>The freedom movement intensified with Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent methods transforming it into a mass
                  movement. This period witnessed numerous satyagrahas, the Civil Disobedience Movement, Quit India
                  Movement, revolutionary activities, and the final phase of negotiations leading to independence and
                  partition.</p>

               <p>Under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's leadership, independent India established democratic
                  institutions, developed a mixed economy with five-year plans, maintained a non-aligned foreign policy,
                  and began the complex process of national integration while dealing with the aftermath of partition.

               <p>India faced multiple challenges including wars with China and Pakistan, the Emergency period,
                  agricultural transformation through the Green Revolution, regional tensions, and economic stagnation,

                  social changes that continue to shape the nation's development trajectory.</p>

            <div class="colonial-info">
               <p>British colonialism fundamentally transformed India's political, economic, and social landscape over
                  two centuries. While primarily driven by extractive economic interests, colonial rule introduced
                  elements of modernity that produced complex and contradictory outcomes for Indian society.</p>

                     <h4>Economic Impact</h4>
                     <p>Colonial policies transformed India from a manufacturing power to a supplier of raw materials
                        and market for British industrial goods. Traditional industries were decimated, while new
                        plantation economies (indigo, tea, coffee) emerged. Railways, built primarily for imperial
                        interests, nevertheless created an integrated economic space.</p>

                  <div class="feature-item">
                     <h4>Administrative Systems</h4>
                     <p>The British established modern bureaucratic governance, a unified legal system, and centralized
                        authority that brought unprecedented administrative uniformity across the subcontinent. The
                        civil service, police, and judicial systems created enduring institutional frameworks that
                        continued after independence.</p>

                     <h4>Social Transformation</h4>
                     <p>Western education introduced new ideas of liberalism, democracy, and nationalism that ironically
                        fueled anti-colonial consciousness. Social reform legislation addressed practices like sati and
                        child marriage, while census operations and anthropological studies reified caste and religious
                        identities in new ways.</p>

                     <h4>Architectural Legacy</h4>
                     <p>British architectural influence created distinctive Indo-European styles visible in government
                        buildings, railway stations, and urban planning. New capital cities like Calcutta, Bombay, and
                        eventually New Delhi embodied imperial power while creating lasting urban landscapes.</p>

               <p>The 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed the emergence of numerous reform movements across India.
                  These movements sought to address social inequities, religious practices, and cultural traditions
                  while negotiating modernity and responding to colonial critiques of Indian society.</p>

                     <p>Founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy in 1828, the Brahmo Samaj promoted monotheism, rational religious
                        thinking, and social reforms including women's education and widow remarriage. It challenged
                        idolatry and criticized caste restrictions while drawing inspiration from both Vedantic
                        philosophy and European Enlightenment thought.</p>

                     <p>Established by Swami Dayanand Saraswati in 1875, the Arya Samaj advocated a return to Vedic
                        principles and opposed idolatry, polytheism, and ritualism. It established educational
                        institutions, promoted women's rights, and developed the shuddhi (reconversion) movement to
                        counter Christian missionary activities.</p>

                     <p>Reformers like Jyotiba Phule in Maharashtra and Periyar E.V. Ramasamy in Tamil Nadu developed
                        radical critiques of caste hierarchy and Brahminical dominance. Their efforts laid foundations
                        for lower-caste political mobilization and influenced later leaders including Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.

                        Women's Conference campaigned for women's education, fought against child marriage, advocated
                        widow remarriage, and worked to improve women's legal and social status in various domains.</p>

                  <h4>Moderate Phase (1885-1905)</h4>
                  <p>Early Congress leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and Surendranath Banerjee
                     employed constitutional methods to petition for reforms and greater Indian representation in
                     administration. They developed the economic critique of colonialism, including the influential
                     "drain of wealth" theory, while building organizational foundations for the nationalist movement.

                  <h4>Swadeshi Movement (1905-1914)</h4>
                  <p>The partition of Bengal in 1905 sparked the first mass movement, with leaders like Bal Gangadhar
                     Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, and Lala Lajpat Rai advocating more assertive approaches than the
                     moderates. The Swadeshi movement promoted indigenous industries and boycott of British goods, while
                     revolutionary organizations emerged advocating armed resistance.</p>

                  <h4>Gandhian Era (1915-1947)</h4>
                  <p>Mahatma Gandhi transformed the independence struggle into a mass movement through innovative
                     methods of non-violent resistance (satyagraha). Major campaigns included the Non-Cooperation
                     Movement (1920-22), Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-34), and Quit India Movement (1942). Gandhi's
                     leadership mobilized ordinary Indians across regions, religions, classes, and genders.</p>

                  <h4>Revolutionary Movements</h4>
                  <p>Parallel to the mainstream movement, revolutionary organizations like the Hindustan Socialist
                     Republican Association (with figures like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad) and the Indian
                     National Army led by Subhas Chandra Bose offered alternative visions of armed resistance to
                     colonial rule, contributing to the broader pressure on British authorities.</p>

            <div class="independence-info">
               <p>The culmination of the freedom struggle in 1947 brought both triumph and tragedy. As India achieved
                  independence after two centuries of colonial rule, the subcontinent was partitioned into two separate
                  nations—India and Pakistan—along religious lines, unleashing unprecedented violence and displacement.

                     <h4>Path to Transfer of Power</h4>
                     <p>Post-World War II, Britain's weakened position, combined with Indian political pressure and
                        civil unrest, made continued colonial rule untenable. Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy,
                        accelerated the timeline for British withdrawal, announcing the Partition Plan in June 1947 with
                        independence scheduled for August.</p>

                     <h4>The Partition</h4>
                     <p>The partition created two dominions based primarily on religious demographics, with
                        Muslim-majority regions forming East and West Pakistan. The hasty boundary commission headed by
                        Sir Cyril Radcliffe drew borders that separated communities with millennia of shared history,
                        triggering massive population exchanges.</p>

                     <h4>Human Cost</h4>
                     <p>Partition violence claimed up to two million lives as communal riots erupted across North India.
                        Approximately 14-16 million people were displaced in one of history's largest forced migrations,
                        creating lasting trauma and permanently altering the demographic landscape of the subcontinent.

                     <p>As India achieved independence at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, Nehru's famous
                        "tryst with destiny" speech captured the mixed emotions of the moment. The new government faced
                        immediate challenges: refugee rehabilitation, preventing further communal violence,

                        western Uttar Pradesh. By achieving food grain self-sufficiency, India overcame the humiliating

                  <p>India's literary landscape flourished through colonial and post-colonial periods, with writers like
                     Rabindranath Tagore, Premchand, R.K. Narayan, and later Salman Rushdie, Arundhati Roy, and Amitav
                     Ghosh creating works that explored national identity, social change, and human experience. Regional
                     language literatures produced major figures while translation increasingly bridged linguistic
                     divides.</p>

                  <h4>Cinema</h4>
                  <p>From Dadasaheb Phalke's early silent films to today's diverse industry producing thousands of films
                     annually, Indian cinema has been a powerful cultural force. Multiple regional industries,
                     particularly Bollywood, have created distinctive cinematic traditions that combine entertainment
                     with social commentary and reflect evolving aspirations and anxieties.</p>

                  <p>Classical traditions in music and dance underwent revival and modernization during the nationalist
                     movement. Artists like M.S. Subbulakshmi, Ravi Shankar, and Rukmini Devi Arundale elevated
                     traditional arts while contemporary expressions emerged through fusion, experimentation, and new
                     institutional support systems.</p>

                  <p>The Bengal School pioneered nationalist artistic expression, while the Progressive Artists' Group
                     later introduced modernist approaches. Contemporary Indian art has gained international recognition
                     through figures like M.F. Husain, Amrita Sher-Gil, and S.H. Raza, addressing themes of identity,
                     history, and social transformation.</p>

            <div class="legacy-info">
               <p>The 1947 partition represents one of the most consequential events in modern South Asian history, with
                  impacts extending far beyond the immediate humanitarian crisis. Its legacy continues to shape
                  geopolitics, national identities, and social relations across the subcontinent.</p>

                        ongoing border disputes particularly in Kashmir, and nuclear proliferation in the region.
                        Periodic peace initiatives have struggled to overcome the foundational tensions stemming from

                        religious minorities in both countries. India's constitutional commitment to secularism
                        contrasted with Pakistan's Islamic identity, though both nations have struggled with protecting

                  development as founding principles. The Congress party dominated politics, with opposition primarily
                  from communist and right-wing parties, while the First Kashmir War and the 1962 China War shaped early
