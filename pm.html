      <h1>The Office of the Prime Minister: India's Chief Executive</h1>
      <p>The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and the leader of the executive branch of the
        Government of India. As the chief advisor to the President and head of the Union Council of Ministers, the
        Prime Minister is the principal architect of India's policy and the most powerful political figure in the
        Indian democratic system. Since India follows a parliamentary system of government modeled after the
        Westminster system, the Prime Minister is typically the leader of the party or coalition that commands a
        majority in the Lok Sabha (House of the People).</p>

        <div class="powers-info">
          <p>While the Constitution of India does not specifically lay down the powers of the Prime Minister, by
            convention and parliamentary practice, the office has evolved into the most powerful position in the Indian
            political system.</p>

          <div class="powers-highlights">
            <div class="power-item">
              <h4>Executive Powers</h4>
              <p>The Prime Minister directs the functioning of the government, allocates portfolios among ministers,
                presides over Cabinet meetings, and coordinates the work of different ministries and departments. The
                PM's Office (PMO) serves as a powerful nerve center of administrative decision-making.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="power-item">
              <h4>Legislative Leadership</h4>
              <p>As the leader of the majority party or coalition in Parliament, the Prime Minister significantly
                influences the legislative agenda, oversees drafting of important bills, and ensures their passage
                through Parliament. The PM also responds to questions, motions, and debates in Parliament.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="power-item">
              <h4>Policy Formulation</h4>
              <p>The Prime Minister plays a decisive role in national policy formulation across domestic and
                international domains, from economic reforms and social welfare to defense and foreign affairs. Major
                policy initiatives typically bear the personal imprint of the Prime Minister.</p>

            <div class="power-item">
              <h4>Appointments</h4>
              <p>The Prime Minister recommends appointments for key positions including cabinet ministers, the Attorney
                General, ambassadors, governors, and heads of commissions and boards. The PM's advice is also crucial
                for appointments of Supreme Court and High Court judges.</p>

      <h3>Prime Minister's Office (PMO): The Nerve Center</h3>
      <div class="rashtrapati-bhavan">
        <div class="rashtrapati-info">
          <p>The Prime Minister's Office (PMO), located in the South Block of the Secretariat Building in New Delhi,
            serves as the institutional nerve center for policy coordination, governance oversight, and strategic
            decision-making in the Indian administrative system.</p>

          <div class="bhavan-features">
            <div class="feature-item">
              <h4>Historical Evolution</h4>
              <p>Originally established as the Prime Minister's Secretariat in 1947, it was renamed as the Prime
                Minister's Office in 1977. The PMO has gradually evolved from a modest support office to a powerful
                institution that often drives major policy initiatives.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-item">
              <h4>Organizational Structure</h4>
              <p>Headed by the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, the PMO comprises senior officials, advisors,
                and support staff organized into various divisions handling subjects like economic affairs, internal
                security, infrastructure, social sectors, and external affairs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-item">
              <h4>Key Functions</h4>
              <p>The PMO provides secretarial assistance to the Prime Minister, serves as a crucial link between the PM
                and different ministries, monitors implementation of key policies, handles public grievances, and
                manages the PM's engagements and communications.</p>

            <div class="feature-item">
              <h4>Significance</h4>
              <p>The size, influence, and operational style of the PMO typically reflects the governance approach of the
                incumbent Prime Minister, with some preferring a more centralized system (larger PMO) while others opt
                for greater ministerial autonomy (leaner PMO).</p>

            technological solutions to governance challenges, welfare programs directly benefiting citizens, and a

          <p>Modi's premiership has witnessed the launch of numerous flagship programs including Ayushman Bharat

            diplomacy, strategic autonomy, neighborhood engagement, and positioning India as a "leading power" rather

          <p>Formerly known as 7, Race Course Road (renamed in 2016), this complex serves as the official residence and
            principal workplace of the Prime Minister of India. Unlike the grand colonial-era Rashtrapati Bhavan, the
            Prime Minister's residence reflects a more understated architectural character.</p>
